# Complete-Disease-Prediction

## A disease prediction WebApp using Reactjs as frontend and python flask as the backend to predict the disease.

Disease Detector is an online site which tells you about the disease you may suffer, according to the symptoms you choose. The more symptoms you provide, the more accurate the results will be. After the result is being predicted a button can be seen which will tell various things like prevention, treatment, facts etc. about the predicted disease!  <br>
<br>

I have used Machine Learning for the prediction of the diseases and it is very accurate in predicting the disease for only 41 diseases as of now, which is the only limitation. I am working to add more diseases and making some improvements which can be seen in the future updates. Stay tuned!
